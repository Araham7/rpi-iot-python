"""
OLED Centered QR Code Display Script

This program generates a QR code from a given text and displays it centered on an SSD1306 OLED screen connected via SPI.
The QR code is resized to fit within a 64x64 pixel area and is displayed in monochrome format. The program ensures the QR code is centered on the OLED display (128x64 pixels).

Steps:
1. Initializes the SPI interface and OLED device using the specified GPIO pins for DC (Data/Command) and RST (Reset).
2. Defines the text to be encoded into a QR code (in this case, a Hindi poetic line).
3. Generates a QR code using the `qrcode` library with low error correction (ERROR_CORRECT_L) and a box size of 10 for clarity.
4. Resizes the QR code image to fit within a 64x64 pixel area.
5. Converts the QR code image to monochrome (1-bit) format for compatibility with the OLED display.
6. Calculates the starting position to center the QR code on the OLED screen (128x64 pixels).
7. Displays the QR code on the OLED screen using the `luma.oled` library.
8. Keeps the program running indefinitely to display the QR code until the user interrupts it (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C).

Dependencies:
- luma.core
- luma.oled
- PIL (Pillow)
- qrcode
- time

Hardware Requirements:
- SSD1306 OLED display connected via SPI.
- GPIO pins for DC (24) and RST (25) as specified in the code.

Usage:
Run the script, and the QR code will be displayed centered on the OLED screen. The program will continue running until manually stopped.

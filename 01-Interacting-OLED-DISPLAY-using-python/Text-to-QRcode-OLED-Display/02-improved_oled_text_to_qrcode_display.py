OLED QR Code Display Script

This program generates a QR code from a given text and displays it on an SSD1306 OLED screen connected via SPI.
The QR code is resized to fit the OLED display's resolution (128x64 pixels) and is displayed in monochrome format.

Steps:
1. Initializes the SPI interface and OLED device using the specified GPIO pins for DC (Data/Command) and RST (Reset).
2. Defines the text to be encoded into a QR code.
3. Generates a QR code using the `qrcode` library with high error correction for better reliability.
4. Resizes the QR code image to fit the OLED screen dimensions (128x64 pixels).
5. Converts the QR code image to monochrome (1-bit) format for compatibility with the OLED display.
6. Displays the QR code on the OLED screen using the `luma.oled` library.
7. Keeps the program running indefinitely to display the QR code until the user interrupts it (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C).

Dependencies:
- luma.core
- luma.oled
- PIL (Pillow)
- qrcode
- time

Hardware Requirements:
- SSD1306 OLED display connected via SPI.
- GPIO pins for DC (24) and RST (25) as specified in the code.

Usage:
Run the script, and the QR code will be displayed on the OLED screen. The program will continue running until manually stopped.
